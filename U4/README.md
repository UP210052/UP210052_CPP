<h2>Things to consider</h2>

- Do not enter numbers with decimal.
- Ships are shown on the board as O
- When you hit the boat, a red X is placed on the board.

<div align="center">
<h2>Player vs PC</h2>

The first thing that appears on the screen is a menu to choose the game mode.

Select 1 since we are going to play multiplayer. You select the size of the ship in this move is 5, then you select the direction which is 1, select the row (with number) which is 8 and finally the row (with letters) which is a.

Then on the board will appear the ship in the set position.

Let's continue to place the boats until only one is missing.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship3.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

Once the last ship has been placed, it is the second player's turn to place the ships.

Let's continue to place the boats until only one is missing.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship5.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

When all the ships are placed we will switch to the shooting mode, in which you will have to give the row and column of your shot.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship6.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

Now we will make a shot in row 0 and column a.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship7.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

On the board is placed an x in white color which means that we missed the shot.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship8.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

When we hit the shot, an X in red color will be placed on the board.  

<img src="../imagenes/Battleship9.png" align="center" height="400" width="600">  

When there are no more ships on the enemy board, the winner message will appear.

## __Conclusion__

</div align="center">
With this project we concluded the 3rd semester, we learned an infinite number of things that we use in the last projects, in which several games that we use daily were made. We know that this will help us in the future to do more projects of such manufacturing. In this project, the problems that were detected were that some of the team never played the naval battle or very little and we had to learn to be able to carry out the project. 
With the help of our teacher we acquired all the necessary tools to conclude this magnificent project in a strong way.
To remember some of our sources:
1. Teacher
2. Play the game
3. Videos
